# monty
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What do LIFO and FIFO mean
What is a stack, and when to use it
What is a queue, and when to use it
What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
What is the proper way to use global variables

the first task involves 

  Implement the push and pall opcodes.

The push opcode

The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

Usage: push <int>
where <int> is an integer
if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number in the file
You wonâ€™t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function
The pall opcode

The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
